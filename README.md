# picoModal-Accessible

A small, self-contained JavaScript modal library, without jQuery or another third party script, for IE8+ and all modern browsers, and accessible.

  * Small: 3.5kb minified, and 1.5k minified & gzipped, it's small and easily embeddable
  * No Dependencies: PicoModal does not depend on any other JS libraries, so you can use it in places where you don't have access to one
  * Cross-browser: It works with IE8+ and all modern browsers
  * Self-contained: No extra CSS or images required; just the JS
  * Simple: The interface is straight forward and easy to use
  * Customizable: By changing a few settings you can customize or completely replace the default styles and behaviour
  * Accessibile: It's screen-reader friendly
